**Lecture 5: Case Studies and Implementation**

* Real-world case studies of successful real-time data analysis 
applications (e.g., finance, healthcare, IoT)
* Group project: students will work in groups to implement a simple 
real-time data analysis pipeline using Python or R
* Discussion of common pitfalls and lessons learned from real-world 
implementations
* Lecture objectives:

 + Develop practical skills for implementing real-time data analysis 
pipelines

Throughout the lectures, I'll incorporate interactive elements, such as:

* Group discussions and debates
* Hands-on exercises and coding challenges
* Real-world case studies and group projects
* Visual aids (e.g., slides, videos) to illustrate key concepts and 
techniques.

This comprehensive lecture plan will provide students with a solid 
foundation in real-time data analysis, covering the technical aspects of 
data ingestion, processing, and visualization, as well as practical 
applications and best practices.
